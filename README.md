# patuta-js
Patuta JS is a jQuery plugin that helps Designers/Developers to Add/Remove table rows without writing JavaScript code.
# How to use
Create a div with the class "add-remove-tbl", and put the table inside that div.
Make sure to put "Add Row" button outside the table.
Add class "addRowBtn" to the "Add Row" button.
Add class "removeRowBtn" to the "Remove Row" button.
Initialize it with "$('body').patuta();"
In case you want to add the "Add/Remove funcationality" to the nested table, just add the class "add-remove-tbl" to your nested table's parent "td" and add the class "nested" to your nested table.
